Project Ideas:

1) Enable user to input three destinations for a vacation within the U.S. Provide a weather forecast for each location using data extracted from the National Weather Service API.

2) You are transported to the 19th century where you are competing with your fellow robber barons to build the longest railroad across the U.S. Compete in a turn-based game to build the longest railroad route.

3) Write a program that converts a YAML file (e.g. Ansible playbook) and converts it to JSON.
